      question: "Why Do Babies Vomit?",
      ans:
        "The most common reason why babies vomit in the early weeks after birth is that is some of the milk is being brought up with some air when baby burps. The other reason why babies vomit often is that the muscle valve at the top of their stomach that opens into the stomach is weak and immature. In adults, this valve closes tightly after swallowing food, to keep food down. It requires much force to push this valve open to allow an adult to vomit. The lid does not close tightly enough in babies. So, a little force can make the valve open, and milk will come out. Baby may also vomit if the baby's stomach is 'overfull,' or is gently pressed on. For example, if you rest the baby too far over your shoulder, or if you bend over your baby with the baby on your laps. Vomiting will improve as the baby grow older from about 6 months to 1 year. It will also improve when the baby starts to sit down and to spend more time sitting.",

      ans: "Every woman has eggs in her in two places in her body above the womb. One egg is released every month so that if a man's sperm meets it, the egg and the sperm can become a baby.  When a woman menstruates, it takes about 28 days before the next menstruation. The first day of the menses is the first day of the menstrual cycle. On the 14th day after the first of day menstruation, an egg comes out to the womb. The egg remains alive for 2 days in the womb waiting for sperm to join with it and make it fertilized so that it can grow into a baby. When the egg is fertilized, it attaches itself to the wall of the womb, and it starts to grow into a baby.The baby grows in the womb for about 9 months, and it is delivered.",
