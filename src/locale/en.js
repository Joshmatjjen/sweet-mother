      question: "Why Do Babies Vomit?",
      ans:
        "The most common reason why babies vomit in the early weeks after birth is that is some of the milk is being brought up with some air when baby burps. The other reason why babies vomit often is that the muscle valve at the top of their stomach that opens into the stomach is weak and immature. In adults, this valve closes tightly after swallowing food, to keep food down. It requires much force to push this valve open to allow an adult to vomit. The lid does not close tightly enough in babies. So, a little force can make the valve open, and milk will come out. Baby may also vomit if the baby's stomach is 'overfull,' or is gently pressed on. For example, if you rest the baby too far over your shoulder, or if you bend over your baby with the baby on your laps. Vomiting will improve as the baby grow older from about 6 months to 1 year. It will also improve when the baby starts to sit down and to spend more time sitting.",

It works when a mother breastfeeds the baby that is less than 6 months old day and night without giving the baby any other food. It prevents the eggs to be released into the womb. It would prevent pregnancy up to 99% if it used correctly and continuously. Note it that does not work for every woman, and it tends to depend on your heredity of the trait.",
        "Calendar method- it uses the calendar to calculate the days when the woman is fertile. It prevents pregnancy for up to 91%. The day that women starts to menstruate is Day 1. You will count to Day 12 after the menstruation and up to Day 16 after the menses. The Day 12 to Day 16 after menstruation is the days when the woman can get pregnant if she has sex without prevention. This means that the total number of days that the woman can get pregnant is 5 days each month. The way you arrive at the 5 days is that a woman's egg will come into her womb the 14th after her menstruation starts. So, she can get pregnant that day. The egg will live for 2 days that means she can get pregnant 2 days after her egg comes into the womb. Then if you add that 2 days to the 14th day you will get the 16th day. However, a male sperm will live for 2 days in the womb before it dies. It means that if a woman has sex without prevention 2 days before her eggs come, then she can still get pregnant. So, you remove 2 days from the 14th day after menstruation you will get the 12th day. Note that to calculate it, the date in the calendar is not what you are counting. It is the day. Hence for example, if your menstruation starts on Monday, July 23, 2018, you will count that Monday as Day 1, and you will count it until you get Day 12 which is Friday, August 3, 2018. Then you will continue to the 16th Day which is Tuesday, August 6, 2018. Therefore, from Friday, August 3 to Tuesday, August 6, 2018, you must prevent yourself from getting pregnant. Please note that the calculation is the same for every woman even if your menstrual cycle is 25 day or 32 days. But it does not work well for women with menstruation that is not regular.",
